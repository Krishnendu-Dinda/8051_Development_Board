# 8051_Development_Board
<br>
In my college when I worked in many projects on embedded system using MCU I face many hardware related problems because of create peripherals circuit in breadboard. 
<br>
 For solved this problem I design this 8051 Development board.That is help the student to avoid many hardware related issues due to printed circuit. 
 <br>
 Here in my Development board include one 8-bit output circuit,one 8-bit input circuit, one 8-bit successive approximation A/D converter ,one 16x2 LCD circuit. and also include the programming pins.
<br> 
 It is more helpful if you all are go through the below attached my GitHub link for any advice & review my design.
